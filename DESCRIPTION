Description: `voluModel` is designed to facilitate modeling species' ecological niches and geographic distributions based on occurrences and environments that have a vertical as well as horizontal component, and projecting models into three-dimensional geographic space. Working in three dimensions is useful in an aquatic context when the organisms one wishes to model can be found across a wide range of depths in the water column.
